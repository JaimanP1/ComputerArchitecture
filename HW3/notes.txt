- When doing twos complement on the bits, need to carry the value when incrementing
	- (4 --> -4): 0100 --> 1011 --> 1100
	- Alternate way to complement each bit to the left of the rightmost bit with value 1
- Unsigned integer multiplication that overflows is equivalent to (x*y)%(2^w)
- Signed integer multiplication is done by assuming unsigned values then performing twos complement on the product
	- For w bit x and y values, represent x*y with 2w bits, even is product can be expressed with fewer. Then truncate
- Practice problem 2.35 is nonsense to me 
- Practice problem 2.37 is helpful: (2^20 + 1) * 2^12 = 2^32 + 2^12 but for 32 bit machine --> (2^32 + 2^12) % 2^32
	- Truncation due to overflow causes product to be 2^12 as opposed to 2^32 + 2^12
- Learn logical/arithmetic bit shifts for (un)/signed integer division
- Memorize floating point conventions for 32/64 bit systems; number of exponent and fraction bits
- Watch a YouTube video or something about (de)/normalized floating point values
- Denormalized values do not have an implied leading 1

There are three operations one can do with a pointer: find the address from which it originates (&), find the address to which it points to (%p), and find the value stored at the pointed to address (format depends on pointer type, %x is generic).

An interesting case is that of strings, where printing the address to which the pointer points to but using %s as opposed to %p gives the entire string, whereas the latter format just gives the address of the first character.

Another interesting case is that of arrays, where the address of the array and the name of the array are the same object; i.e. &array and array will be treated as a pointer to the first element.

The last important thing to note is that the values are printed in little endian format, with each successive byte containing a larger significant figure in hex. The default for placeholder zeroes is 'f'.

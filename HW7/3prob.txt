A) The leaq instruction of line 5 computes the value 8n + 30, which is then
rounded down to the nearest multiple of 16 by the andq instruction of line 6.
The resulting value will be 8n + 8 when n is odd and 8n + 16 when n is even,
and this value is subtracted from s1 to give s2.

B) %r8 holds a 16 byte aligned address, which is greater than %rsp + 15

D) p is 16 byte aligned and s2 has the same alignment as s1.
